\section{Amended Milestones - (mh23g08)}
\label{sec:amended_milestones}
As the project progressed and design decisions were made some of the milestones in section
\ref{sec:initial_milestones} were amended, with milestones being added, removed or made more
specific and granular as the project progressed. This section describes the amendments to the
initial milestones and provides a the final list of milestones with which project progress was measured
against.

To assist comprehension the milestones have been arranged into a number of categories,
relating to the way in which the project work has been broken up. 

\subsection{Camera Module Communication Milestones}
sections. 
%\begin{itemize}
	\subsubsection{Basic Camera Connection}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 	A basic connection to the camera should be established
				where the camera responds correctly to connection 
				commands (if applicable to type of camera.)
		\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Image from Camera}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 	\emph{Basic Camera Connection} milestone above should
				be completed.
			\item 	An image should be shown to have been downloaded 
				from the camera - this should be repeatable without
				need to reset the camera.
			\item 	This image may be of any resolution and colour type.
		\end{itemize} 

	\subsubsection{Changing Camera Resolution}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \emph{Image from Camera} milestone should be completed.
			\item 	An image should be shown to have been downloaded 
				from the camera as in the \emph{Image from Camera}
				task.
			\item 	This image should be of a specified resolution which
				should be changeable.
		\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Changing Camera Colour Type}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 	\emph{Image from Camera} milestone should be completed.
			\item 	An image should be shown to have been downloaded 
				from the camera as in the \emph{Image from Camera}
				task.
			\item 	This image should be of a specified colour type which
				should be changeable.
		\end{itemize}

%\end{itemize}

\subsection{Payload to Ground Station Communications Milestones}
%\begin{itemize}
	\subsubsection{Payload Responding to Transmit Tokens}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 	The payload module should respond to transmit tokens
				sent by the autopilot. 
			\item 	The \verb+payload[0].timeout+ command when input into
				the customers ground station software should return 
				\verb+FALSE+.
		\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Payload Setting Shared Memory on Autopilot}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 	\emph{Payload Responding to Transmit Tokens} milestone
				should have been completed.
			\item 	The payload module should set the \verb+MEM_BYTES+ 
				shared memory assigned to it to a recognizable value.
		\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Payload Receiving Messages from Ground Station}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 	The payload should receive and respond in some way to 
				data sent by the \verb+payload[0].send_bytes+ command
				when executed on the ground station.
		\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Image Sending to Ground Station via Autopilot Link}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 	\emph{Payload Setting Shared Memory on Autopilot} milestone
				should be completed.
			\item 	An image taken with the camera module should be sent to the
				ground station by the payload controller via the autopilot link.
		\end{itemize}


	\subsubsection{Triggering Image Capture from Ground Station}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 	\emph{Payload Receiving Messages from Ground Station} milestone
				should be completed.
			\item 	A specified set of data sent using \verb+payload[0].send_bytes+
				from the ground station should trigger the payload to take a picture.
		\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Changing Camera Resolution from Ground Station}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 	\emph{Payload Receiving Messages from Ground Station} and 
				\emph{Changing Camera Resolution} milestones should be completed.
			\item 	A specified set of data sent using \verb+payload[0].send_bytes+
				from the ground station should change the camera resolution with 
				the same outcomes as the \emph{Changing Camera Resolution} milestone.
		\end{itemize}


	\subsubsection{Changing Colour Type from Ground Station}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 	\emph{Payload Receiving Messages from Ground Station} and 
				\emph{Changing Camera Colour Type} milestones should be completed.
			\item 	A specified set of data sent using \verb+payload[0].send_bytes+
				from the ground station should change the camera resolution with 
				the same outcomes as the \emph{Changing Camera Colour Type} milestone.
		\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Progressive Image Download}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 	\emph{Image from Camera} milestone should be completed.
			\item 	An image should be downloaded progressively from the payload to the
				ground station.
			\item 	Additional milestones relating to this area are to be added as design decisions
				are made.
		\end{itemize}

\subsection{Physical Implementation Milestones}
Many of the milestones listed above rely upon a working physical implementation of the system at each stage
so these will not be duplicated. However, there are a few milestones which are specific to the physical implementation
of the system.
%Customer Provided `Dummy' Payload Schematics Working

%Camera connection

%Payload communication

	\subsubsection{Payload Breadboard Prototype}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A finalized PCB design ready to be sent for manufacture. 
		\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Payload PCB Design}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A finalized PCB design ready to be sent for manufacture. 
		\end{itemize}
		
	\subsubsection{Complete System on PCB}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A working system implementation on PCB.
		\end{itemize}
