\section{JPEG Image Compression}
The images obtained from the camera will be in the JPEG image format. If the image data is sent to the ground station progressively, it must be necessary to understand how a JPEG image is structured to reconstruct the encoded image. Unlike raw image data, which can easily be read continuously, JPEG files have already been compressed and contain information which must first be read to properly decompress the image.

\subsection{JPEG structure}
A JPEG file can be separated into two main parts. The first part of the JPEG file is composed of segments containing information concerning various properties of the image which must be read in order to recover the image from its compressed form. The second part contains the entropy-encoded image data, which can be decoded using the information provided from the headers of the file.  

The segments which make up the image file properties are indicated by header markers. ``Each marker is immediately preceded by an all 1 byte (0xff).'' (Header guide) This marker is then followed by a marker identifier byte specific to that segment type. The 0xff value will always indicates the start of the header in this part, but is treated differently in the image data stream. ``If a 0xff byte occurs in the compressed image data either a zero byte (0x00) or a marker identifier follows it.'' (Header guide) 0xff bytes followed by a zero byte are read in as the hexadecimal value 0xff and the 0x00 byte is ignored entirely. 0xff bytes not following this a 0x00 byte are considered to be the header byte of the next segment. If the segment contains useful information before the next marker identifier, it is then followed by two bytes specifying the total length of the segment (in bytes). For the SOS segment, this does not include the entropy-encoded image data.

\subsubsection{JPEG Segments}
The number of headers found within a JPEG image file is not constant between images. The JPEG headers are capable of storing most of the metadata related to an image, not all of which is necessary for the decompression of the image. The following headers are those which contain all the information necessary for a successful decompression of the JPEG image, as well as those which can be found in all JPEG images. The number in brackets next to the segment name is the unique marker identifier value which appears directly after the 0xff marker indicator byte. All numerical values obtained from the byte stream are unsigned. ``DQT, DHT, DRI and SOF may line up in any order, but must be recorded after APP1 (or APP2 if any) and before SOS.'' (Exif)

\paragraph*{SOI: Start Of Image (0xd8)}
This header identifies the start of the image and can be found in all JPEG images. This is the first header to be read in a JPEG file. This header does not contain any information to be stored by the decompression algorithm, but can be useful for differenciating multiple JPEG images from a single data stream.

\paragraph*{APP0: JFIF application segment (0xe0)}
There can be many APP segments in a single image. Subsequent APP segments are named ``APP\emph{n}'' with a marker identifier of 0xe\emph{n} with \emph{n} being the number of the APP segment. This segment does not contain any information necessary to the decompression algorithm used, so all APP segments ignored.

\paragraph*{SOF0: Start Of Frame (0xc0)}
``SOF is a marker code indicating the start of a frame segment and giving various parameters for that frame'' (Header guide) /this indicates that the image is a ``DCT-based JPEG, and specifies the width, height, number of components, and component subsampling (e.g., 4:2:0)'' as well as the data precision (in bits/sample) of an image. (narcap) From the component subsampling information, the size of the Minimum Coded Unit (MCU) which make up the JPEG image. Just like the APP segments, there can be multiple start of frame segments in more complex images, but the images sent by the camera will only need the information contained in the first SOF segment.

\paragraph*{DHT: Define Huffman Table(s) (0xc4)}
This segment defines the properties of one or many Huffman table(s) (HT) which will be used to decode the entropy-encoded image data. ``A single DHT segment may contain multiple HTs, each with its own information byte.'' This segment includes the number of the HT as identified by the image data and the type of the HT (either DC or AC) It also stores the ''number of symbols with codes of length 1..16, the sum (n) of these bytes is the total number of codes, which must be $\leq$ 256'' as well as ``the symbols in order of increasing code length ( n = total number of codes )'' (Header guide). In practice, a single image can also contain multiple DHT segments which all share the same marker identifier. 

\paragraph*{DQT: Define Quantization Table(s) (0xdb)}
This segment defines the properties of one or many quantization table(s).

\paragraph*{SOS: Start Of Scan (0xda)}
This segment gives various scan-related parameters and is the last segment preceding the entropy-encoded image data. This segment associates each component in the scan with the appropriate AC and DC Huffman table by their ID number. 3 ignorable bytes seperate this segment from the image data. 

\paragraph*{EOI: End Of Image (0xd9)}
This header identifies the end of the image. ''It is possible that the end of the image is reached without finding the EOI marker. In this case, the image is technically malformed but the situation is tolerated and handled as if the EOI marker was found.`` (winzip)

\chapter{Specification}
%% ----------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Proposed Brief}
The original agreed project specification and plan, handed in on the first week of the project, was to design, build, and test an electronic module capable of capturing still images from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and transmitting the images to a ground station. The module must use the UAV autopilot’s low-bandwidth RS485 serial link (38.4 kBaud). A program must be written to interface with the base station software over a TCP/IP link, allowing image data to be received and then displayed to the user. The electronic module would be constructed using strip-boards and would later be implemented on PCB if time is available.


\section{Objectives} 
The aim of the project was to achieve the following criteria, which were also prioritized in order to ensure organized and efficient work: (maybe add some justification to the why things were certain priorities?)


\begin{itemize}
	\item The image would be encoded in such a way that a low quality image will be available quickly, the quality of which would improve as more information is downloaded. [high priority]
	\item Minimise the time needed to download the images from the UAV to the base station. The time from the user’s prompt until the image has been fully downloaded will be measured against the theoretical 3 minutes necessary to transmit a full image without using any compression. The goal will be to obtain a full image in \textbf{less than 3 minutes.} [high priority]
	\item The module weight will be\textbf{less than 250g}. [medium priority]
	\item Image resolution of \textbf{640x480}. [medium priority]
	\item Allow the user to perform the following actions on the UAV’s camera from the base station:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Prompt the UAV to \textbf{capture and download an image}. [high priority]
		\item \textbf{Cancel} the downloading of any image while the image is being downloaded. [medium priority]
		\item \textbf{Resend} an image in case the current preview is corrupted. [low priority]
		\item \textbf{Interrupt} the download of an incomplete image and allow the user to save the incomplete image. [low priority]
		\item Select the \textbf{resolution settings} of the image. [low priority]
		\item Display a progress indicator which will show the percentage of the image datareceived, as well as a time estimate for the rest of the image to be downloaded. [low priority]
		\item The image capture will be triggered automatically by the UAV using triggers built into the autopilot. [low priority]
		\item Allow the user to command the image capture to \textbf{trigger periodically} over a \textbf{userspecified time interval} will be added if time permits. [low priority]
	\end{itemize}
	\item Images will be transmitted in \textbf{colour} as opposed to black and white. [low priority]
	\item The user can select between a colour image and a black and white. [low priority]
\end{itemize}


\section{Deliverables}
The deliverables which were planned to be produced by the end of the project to the customer include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \underline{Hardware}: Camera module, constructed on PCB (if time permits, otherwise on strip-board),including layout designs.
	\item \underline{Software}: All firmware for the electronic module, and software on the base station for viewing images. The full source code and all executable files will be included.
	\item \underline{Documentation}: Technical and User Documentation. This includes all schematics related to hardware as well as all other documents concerning both the software and hardware delivered.
	\item \underline{Public repository}: The full source code, all schematics, and all documents concerning both the software and hardware will be included on a public repository so that the client may share this information with his clients.
\end{itemize}
