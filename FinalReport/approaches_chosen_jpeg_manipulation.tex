\section{Progressive JPEG Manipulation}

\subsection{JPEG Manipulation}

Prior to knowing the exact speed it would take to send an image from the camera to the ground station, 
it was decided that custom JPEG manipulation would optimize the image further and help reach the target time specified. 
Therefore, tasks concerning the custom manipulation of the JPEG image were planned and worked on at the beginning of the project. 
However, when a working module was constructed, the time needed to send the image was already well within the specified time. 
Because this was the primary advantage of the custom JPEG manipulation process, the task's priority was dropped accordingly.

\subsection{JPEG Data Access}

The dynamic form of data accessing was preferred due to the memory contraints imposed on the device.

\subsection{Entropy-Encoded Data Storage}

The entropy-encoded data will be stored as chrominance pixels for the sake of clarity. 
It is also a method which could be coded more easiliy than seperate component storage. 
This allowed the extractor to work with the progressive JPEG encoder sooner to avoid the task from overrunning.
