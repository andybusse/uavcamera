- andy not here

- possible that transmission fast enough not to require custom compression
- drop down custom compression priority
	- have one person working on the custom compression stuff
	- mitch will be working on this
	- mitch will assume we get 64 bytes at a time from the camera to the custom compression code
	- 'c read binary file'
	- goals by next monday: 21/11/2011
		- extract relevant jpeg header info (by tuesday evening)
		- use this in the huffman coder (talk to michael)
		- rest we will worry about later
- john will try to add bus/tristate buffer for the tx rx on arduino to allow camera and
payload to communicate
- peak will work on getting payload to work
- michael will also work on getting payload to work
- when finished payload peak will work on ground station UI
- andy working on payload code for the ardunio
- andy assigned to pcb production (should talk more about this tomorrow)

essential tasks remaining:
	- payload to autopilot communication (all on one chip)
	- ground station software and UI
