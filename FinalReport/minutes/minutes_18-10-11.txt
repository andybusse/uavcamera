- mitch has looked up lots on image compression, has pseudocode, will try to look at doing it in C, will also write up different compression algorithms

- peak has some working code for communicating with the autopilot

- we now have components

What we have done:
-----------------
- UAV responding: data extracted
- can recieve data from UAV

- compression + decompression:
    - algorithm pseudo code
- components recieved
-Matlab starter code

Next tasks:
----------------
- Write up theory.
- Implement compression algos in C (encoding) and decoding in any language - mitch, peak
    - ensure encoding works on micro-controller
    
- Basic construction of payload
- Interactionn with payload
- Get any camera working
