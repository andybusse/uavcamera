01-11-11, 4pm-5pm, Hartley Library Room 1A

Agenda: Start setting some deadlines, thrash out some ideas for the final product.

Deadline 1: Feature Freeze ("bells + whistles" features) - Next Wednesday (09-11)
Deadline 2: PCB Production Deadline - Next Friday (11-11)
^ This allows two weeks for delivery/testing of the boards before the presentations

Possibilities for deliverables: 
- Arduino + daughter board. Daughter board contains SD card, ethernet socket, transceiver module, level converter, etc. (Swish, easy to get a hold of, ATmega168 and 328P compatible, but not much memory)
- If arduino not powerful enough, port to Olimexino (built in microSD! Cortex M3, not AVR). Language is basically the same, with the Maple IDE libraries. Potential supply issues with the Olimex - coolcomponents is continually running out.
- AVR on Stripboard?

- We now have "Il Matto", a playing-card sized, arduino-inspired dev board made for last year's D4 lab. Contact Steve Gunn for more info.
- Based on an ATMega644
- No charging circuit has actually been implemented on it (there is some breadboard space and a schematic/PCB layout saying what needs to go where
- Project plan, reaction to circumstances seems to be a good 'un
- We ought to start putting effort into the report.
- LaTeX, Google Docs. (Former is nicer for version control)
