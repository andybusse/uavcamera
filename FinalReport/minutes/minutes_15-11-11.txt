15-11-2011, 4pm-5.30pm, Hartley Library Room 1B

Agenda: Beat together a report structure, review any further progress made.

Taking some inspiration from the example LaTeX GDP report on Steve Gunn's webpage (NB: This is highly subject to change / re-ordering):

=====
* Introduction (mentioning that it's also for proof "payload" of concept)
* Background Research
    - Image Compression: JPEG Structure / Huffman Coding
    - Choice of Camera / Payload Documentation / GCS.exe
    - Hardware Selection: Payload Controller (AVR/Arduino/Olimex/etc.) / Programming Language (C/C#)
* Specification
    - Proposal (Handed in first week)
    - Consideration of options
* Development [1]
    - Research, possible solutions, design approaches
* Hardware [1]
* Software [1]
* Overview
    - Final Deliverables
* Project Management
    - Gantt Charts (more than just first one)
    - Risk Management (from presentation 1, also risks encountered)
    - Work Allocation (planned, actual)
    - Meetings (minutes in annexe?)
* Future Work [2]
    - (Real-time) video, (higher-res) other cameras, better GUI, progressive scan, radar, additional setting choices
* Evaluation [2]
* Conclusions
* Documentation
    - User Manual
    - Technical Docs
    - Source Code (github/sourceforge/somewhere public) (GPL'd)
    - BOM (Bill of Materials)
* APPENDICES
    - BOM
    - Gantt
    - Source Code
    - Presentations (links to, not all the slides)
    - Minutes
    - SVN / git log (github charts).
=====

[1] Think it may be nicer to combine this into "Technical Content" section. (or something slightly better worded):
    - Camera <-> Payload Controller (SD Card)
    - Payload Controller (SD Card) <-> Autopilot
    - (Autopilot <->) Ground Station Software
[2] These two sections could probably be combined. (Evaluation containing what future work could be done)

PROGRESS MADE: Image from camera to SD card. Complete. Including a file numbering situation. Some quirks that need to be ironed out, though (power cycling of camera, removal of camera RX/TX to program arduino) . (svn r97, git 04e4d70b, 10/11/11) JOY!

TO DO: Docs, Payload link (Matt Bennett has been emailed), Progressive JPG, User Interface. See yesterday's minutes for who's been re-assigned to what.
