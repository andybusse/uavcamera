\section{Work Allocation}

Working in a group has its advantages, but it also has drawbacks. The group has more man power and time, but the effectiveness of work allocation and other management skills must be achieved. Therefore, to use all the human resources as competent as possible. Although the developers have known about the specification of the project well, it is not so obvious how to implement the entirely approach to the project that is driven by some device which the members never have seen it before such as camera module, and the UAV. The following factor has been considered thoroughly before assigning task to any team members:

\begin{itemize}
\item	Availability of each member.

\item	The resource limitation
 
\item	The clarification of the task

\item   Time allowance for unexpected problems

\item	Each individual skills
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Planned Work Allocation}
 It is very essential that each member other coursework deadline and exams include in the consideration of work allocation. 
The engineer will work effectively if they got assigned  to their interest in the duty and that role clarified well. The work assign to each individual will be based on the posses sufficient skill and knowledge to perform the task. However, the team members must have flexibility in their time in order to support other team members when they have problems. Each task has been assigned a task leader and it will have the another member set to the same task in case the task leader has problems with the work they have done. In order to avoid work over run the time, the project has been set an earlier deadline so that if any unexpected problems happen, there are still a spare time to solve the problem. The specific skills that individuals want to mention are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Andy: Power, PCB, Control, MATLAB
\item Mitch: Image Processing, MATLAB, ASM, Report Writing
\item John: MATLAB, Image Processing, Control, Radio Transmission
\item Peak: Digital Control, Display, MATLAB, Information Theory
\item Michael: Programming, $\mu$Processors, Interfaces
\end{itemize}

Each member has variety of skills. Therefore the task has been located to each person according to this list.

The time line of the task is also important because some task for each individual depend on a completion of another task. This cause problems when one task got stuck and so the productiveness of the time management will be reduced. This can be solved by assigning another task that is not dependant on the other tasks. 

A Resource limitation is one of the factor that limited the group member to do tasks. This is because the customer provide only a single UAV and also only one camera has been purchased, so only one person can work on this device at a time. We solved this problem by having a laboratory space that the UAV will be placed their all the time so any of the team member can access it. To mange the limited resource, the only time that the individual access the UAV is when he wants to test the system. 

To clarify the tasks so the individuals can understand and also to ensure that all the tasks have been assigned is essential. The real development of this project will analyze the requirement from the start of how the project could be ensemble. The project will be a bottom-up design. It will start from each individual completion of a small task and then integrate them into a successful complete project. 



\subsection{Actual Task Allocation}

In the real work environment, the unexpected situation happens at all time. Each members of the group face different problem, some problem is easy to solved but some is very difficult and time consuming. The back up plan and unplanned problem solving skills is needed. Although many problems happens, but all the team members have been flexible to support each other and most main problems have been solved.

Figure\ref{systemBlocD} shows a block diagram of the whole system that the developers has slitted in to blocks of tasks. 
The camera module and other hardware have uncontrollable acquiring time. Some of the group members has problem with the delay of the hardware deliveries. Therefore, the time has to extended longer than the gantt chart. The solution to this is the software has been developed according to the camera sheet of the hardware. And at this stage, the background reading is very necessary so the developers has used this waiting time to plan and develop the software, so when the components arrive, all the task can be implemented.

The task that depend on acquiring the camera are the communication between the payload and the camera,prototype camera module, and image encoding. The problem that the developers have is the camera delivered is a faulty.These tasks has been suspended until the camera have arrived.  Therefore, the new camera has to be purchased and the allocation of work is necessary. There are part that is not depended on the hardware such as encoding/decoding images, and ground station software. So the members who were assigning to work on the camera has been allocate to do the software part first.

The payload controller has the problem with the hardware part of the UAV. The payload did not respond to the UAV signal at first. Therefore, we assign another group member to support this problems. The task leader of this has been assigned to do another software module which have to be implemented. This problem also need a support from the customer to update the UAV firmware. After the problem have been noticed, it has been solved successfully. 

The SD card memory task was considered as a small task in the planned work, but in the real implementation it is very important. Therefore, we assign on of the member responsible to this task. The SD started to implemented after the camera have been arrive and implemented correctly. 

Because there is only one camera purchased, only one member of the team assign to keep the camera. There are problems with the cameras including the delay of deliveries, and camera faulty. The task leader of this has been assign to research on the progressive image on MATLAB in order to make a prototype presentation of a compression image taken. The task has been delayed from the time set to an individual. But after the second working camera arrived, the task has been done beautifully and there is enough time to combine with other tasks.
