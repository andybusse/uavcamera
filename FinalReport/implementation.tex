\section{Overview (mh)}

The payload controller module is an important part of the system, responsible
for interfacing with the camera module and communicating with the ground 
station image viewer software via the autopilot. Since this single module 
encapsulates a significant amount of the complexity of the project it was 
deemed sensible to split it up into sub-modules, which could be worked on in
parallel by different members of the team. 

With this in mind the payload controller module was split into four main 
submodules:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Camera Module Communication
	\item Communication with Ground Station via Autopilot
	\item SD Card Image Buffering
	\item Progressive JPEG Manipulation
\end{itemize}

\section{Integration of Payload Sub-Modules (mh)}
\label{sec:int_pl}
%|||||||| REMINDER: DISCUSSION OF ARDUINO MULTIPLEXED SERIAL

\subsection{Integration of Camera Module with SD Card}
Both the camera module and SD card module were initially prototyped and 
partially tested separately,
%|||||| REFS ||||||||
but were integrated at
a fairly early stage. This integration was the easiest way of testing the 
camera module, since the images from the camera could be written to the SD
card, allowing for easy inspection.

\subsection{Integration of Camera Module and SD Card with Payload-Ground Station Communication}
Integrating the camera module with the payload to ground station communications
was a major milestone for the project, since completing it would mean we would
have a basic working system. It was also one of the most challenging parts of
the project. This step was performed iteratively over time, with the most basic
features being implemented, integrated and tested before more advanced features
were attempted

Integration of the Payload-Ground Station communications with the Camera module
was completed on the ATMega644P hardware, please see section \ref{sec:atmega644p_impl}
for more info about this aspect and an idea of the challenges and problems
faced.

\subsection{Integration of Progressive JPEG Manipulation}
Unfortunately due to time constraints we were not able to integrate the
progressive JPEG manipulation code into the payload module, please see section \ref{sec:implementation_progressive_jpeg} for more information.

\subsection{Implementation on Arduino}
\label{sec:implementation_arduino}
Initially we planned to implement the system on the Arduino prototyping 
platform with an expansion `shield' board providing any extra hardware needed -
the reasons for this are discussed in section \ref{sec:appr_considered_arduino}.
The camera module connection code had also already been developed and tested on
the Arduino. 

This plan relied on the implementation of a multiplexed serial solution, where
the single serial port of the Arduino would be used to connect to two different
devices (the camera and the autopilot) at different baud rates and message
formats. It was planned that this would be achieved by the use of tristate
buffers to form a bus with the two devices TX and RX lines. The payload software
could then take care of altering the message format and speed when needed.

Unfortunately, due to time constraints alongside setbacks such as those
discussed in sections \ref{sec:probls_pl} and \ref{sec:cam_prob}
 it was decided that implementing the system on the 
Arduino platform may not the best way to proceed. The main reason for this 
decision was the number of unknowns in the planned multiplexed implementation
- since it was not really how the hardware is designed to be used, it was not
certain it would provide satisfactory results in the limited time that we had.

\subsection{Implementation on ATMega644P}
\label{sec:atmega644p_impl}
Several options were considered alongside the multiplexing option discussed above. One alternative workaround discussed was to use a separate AVR as an interface to the autopilot and connect it to the Arduino using bit-banged SPI or the inbuilt two-wire interface (TWI, sometimes known as I2C). This approach was 
attractive as it meant we could use the existing Arduino code for the camera 
and SD card and use the existing ATMega168 code for the autopilot communication.
However, this solution would add another complex component to the system along
with another communications link, increasing complexity significantly.

Another option considered was using an AVR device with multiple UARTs so one 
could be used for the camera and another for the autopilot link. However, 
the code we had written for interacting with the SD card buffer relied upon 
some Arduino specific libraries. Finding new libraries and rewriting this code 
would be time consuming and inefficient, especially since we had already 
invested time in creating a working SD card solution.

Further investigation into the Arduino SD card library code (for more info
regarding the library see reference \cite{arduino_sd_library}) suggested that
it was coded to work with the ATMega644P chip as well as the ATMega168 and
ATMega328P. Both the ATMega168 and ATMega328P feature only one UART, but the 
ATMega644P features two, making it attractive for use in this project (see
\cite{atmega644p} for more info about the ATMega644P).

Since the ATMega644P provides two UARTs and the SD card library we were using
supported this chip it was decided that using the 644P would be a sensible 
way forward. 

It is important to note that frequent progress reviews meant that the problem of how to implement this integration and the need for 2 serial lines was caught early and controlled before it could become more damaging.

As mentioned above in section \ref{sec:payload_existing_code} the code provided
to us for communication with the autopilot was written for an ATMega168 chip. 
Porting this code and the existing Arduino camera code to the 644P was not a 
trivial task, although it was simplified by the use of the Sanguino library -
a port of the Arduino core libraries to the 644P (see \cite{sanguino}). Some 
changes were made the the Sanguino libraries for use in our project, for 
example the Sanguino handling code for one of the UARTs was disabled to allow
it to be configured manually for autopilot communications. Some small pieces
of code that were causing compilation issues were also modified.

\section{Debug Interface (mh)}
\label{sec:payload_debug_interface}
While the payload module was being developed debugging was a major concern. 
Having access to an oscilloscope very useful when debugging some particularly 
difficult problems.
However, while building the payload module it was clear more complex details 
about the internal state of the program as it was running would be useful.

While prototyping the camera module on the Arduino platform this problem was 
solved by using the \emph{SoftwareSerial} library (for information regarding 
the library see \cite{software_serial}) to send textual debug information via
a serial to USB cable to PC. This proved very useful when prototyping camera
communications.

A slightly different approach was taken when using the ATMega644P. Initial 
testing of the software serial library on this platform suggested that it 
would not work without a significant investment in time fixing it. It was
therefore decided that it would be faster to send debug messages over 
`bit-banged' SPI to a spare Arduino board which then forwarded this data to 
the connected PC over serial. Again, having the use of this debug interface 
proved very useful while implementing the system, and was well worth the 
small amount of extra time taken to develop it.

Figure \ref{fig:debud_conn} shows an example of this debug interface seen on
a serial terminal on a PC.

\end{figure}


%\section{Development Testing and Debugging (mh)}
%The payload module and submodules were tested throughout development in order 
%to ensure the latest changes and features added were working as expected. 
%This allowed bugs to be caught and fixed as quickly as possible, as well as
%increasing our knowledge of the current state and progress of the system and
%project as a whole.
