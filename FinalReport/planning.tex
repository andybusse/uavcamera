\section{Introduction}

\section{Initial Milestones - (mh23g08)}
\label{sec:initial_milestones}
A set of milestones have been devised to help track progress and inform test plans.
Each of the milestones represents a real and measurable progress step towards the 
end goals of this project, the milestones were derived from the tasks listed in the initial
Gantt chart (see appendix |||||||||||). It should be noted that these were the initial
milestones derived for the project and were substantially amended throughout the course of
the project in order to keep them relevant - the final state of the amended milestones
can be seen later in section \ref{sec:amended_milestones}.

To assist comprehension the milestones have been arranged into a number of categories,
relating to the way in which the project work has been broken up.

\subsection{Payload Module - Camera Module Communication Milestones}
sections. 
%\begin{itemize}
	\subsubsection{Milestone: Prototype Camera Module Communication}
	\label{sec:ms_init_prototype_camera_module_comms}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 	Initial basic communication with a camera module, an image should be
				downloaded from the camera and viewed in some way.
		\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Milestone: Payload controller to/from camera module communication}
	\label{sec:ms_init_payload_controller_camera_module}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 	An image should be downloaded from the camera on to the 
				payload controller hardware.
			\item 	Sub milestones are as follows:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item The payload controller should be capable of changing the
					image resolution of the camera.
				\item The payload controller should be capable of changing the
					colour type of the camera.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}

%\end{itemize}

\subsection{Payload Module - Image Encoding and Transmission Milestones}
%\begin{itemize}
	\subsubsection{Milestone: Basic Raw Encoding}
		\label{sec:ms_init_basic_raw_encoding}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 	The payload module should send raw image data in the same form as 
				obtained from the camera via the autopilot link
				to the ground station where it should be saved or viewed in some manner
				to verify the milestone.
		\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Milestone: Custom (Progressive/Compressed) Encoding - Matlab Algorithm Prototype}
		\label{sec:ms_init_custom_enc_matlab}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 	A prototype of progressive encoding prototyped in matlab
				should be implemented. This algorithm should demonstrate how the image
				could be sent progressively and ideally in a compressed form.
		\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Milestone: Custom Encoding Algorithm Implementation on Payload Controller}
		\label{sec:ms_init_custom_enc_payload}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 	Milestone \ref{sec:ms_init_custom_enc_matlab} should be implemented on
				the payload controller module.
		\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Milestone: Custom Encoding Data Breakdown and Transmission to Ground Station via Autopilot Link}
		\label{sec:ms_init_custom_breakdown_transmission}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 	The progressive data produced by milestone
				\ref{sec:ms_init_custom_enc_payload} should be broken down and sent
				via the autopilot link to the ground station.
		\end{itemize}

\subsection{Payload Module Construction Milestones}
Many of the milestones listed above rely upon a working physical implementation of the system at each stage
so these will not be duplicated. However, there are a few milestones which are specific to the physical implementation
of the system.
%Customer Provided `Dummy' Payload Schematics Working

%Camera connection

%Payload communication

	\subsubsection{Milestone: Payload Breadboard Prototype}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A finalized PCB design ready to be sent for manufacture.
		\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Milestone: Payload PCB Design}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A finalized PCB design ready to be sent for manufacture. 
		\end{itemize}
		
	\subsubsection{Milestone: Complete System on PCB}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A working system implementation on PCB.
		\end{itemize}

%Final implementation

\subsection{Ground Station Image Viewer Milestones}
	\subsubsection{Milestone: Basic Dummy Server Communications}
		\label{sec:ms_init_basic_dummy_server_comms}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 	Some prototype programs should be produced to help understand TCP/IP communications.
				One server program serving some test data over a TCP/IP port and one
				client program connecting to this port and sending/receiving test data.
		\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Milestone: Communications with Customers Ground Station Sofware}
		\label{sec:ms_init_basestation_comms}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 	Milestone \ref{sec:ms_init_basic_dummy_server_comms} should be
				completed.
			\item 	Communication with the customers ground station software via TCP/IP console and
				data port. Data should be streamed from some known source and verified correct and
				commands should be sent via the port and verified that they execute in the program.
		\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Milestone: Decode Basic Raw Image}
		\label{sec:ms_init_decode_basic_raw_image}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 	Milestone \ref{sec:ms_init_basestation_comms} should be completed.
			\item 	Data sent from the implementation of \ref{sec:ms_init_basic_raw_encoding} should be
				decoded and saved/displayed on the ground station in some way.
		\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Milestone: Custom Decoding - Matlab Implementation}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 	Milestone \ref{sec:ms_init_custom_enc_matlab} should be completed.
			\item 	Data sent from the implementation of \ref{sec:ms_init_custom_enc_matlab} should be
				decoded and saved/displayed on the ground station in some way. NB: This does not require
				a working payload implementation.
		\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Milestone: Custom Decoding - Deployable Implementation}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 	Milestone \ref{sec:ms_init_decode_basic_raw_image} should be completed.
			\item 	Data sent from the implementation of \ref{sec:ms_init_custom_breakdown_transmission} should be
				decoded and saved/displayed on the ground station in some way.
		\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Milestone: Functional User Interface}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 	A functional user interface that allows users to take images and view them using the implementations
				for the milestones described above.
		\end{itemize}
