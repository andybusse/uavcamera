\section{Introduction (ps)}
This section will describe the partitioning of tasks into milestones as well as provide the steps to be taken to achieve the final outcome.
The risk management has been planned carefully to ensure a back up plan for any possible risk.
This section also includes the work allocated to each group member.
It also describes the group resources such as the budget, laboratory equipment, and customer's supply.

\section{Group Communication (ab)}
\label{group_comms}

\subsection{Formal Meetings}
\label{formal meetings}
For the duration of the project, we held weekly meetings on most Tuesday 
Afternoons from 4pm onwards in the Hartley Library. This would allow us to 
review progress made against progress expected, and to modify our project 
plan and allocation of work for the following week.

Minutes of these meetings would be stored in our repository.
The timing of these meetings (the afternoon before our weekly meetings with our 
supervisor) will allow us to present a clear outline 
of new developments and our week-by-week plans to our supervisor.
The meetings with our supervisor will allow the group members to assess their situation
and re-organize themselves if necessary.

\subsection{Methods of Communication (ms)}

The group was prepared to use two primary methods of communication during the project
in-between group meetings. This would allow the group to share any urgent information
with each other easily.
These methods of communication are discussed below:

\subsubsection{E-mail}

Email would be the primary form of communication between group members
in between the weekly group meetings. It will be the responsibility of each group
member to regularly check their e-mail and keep up to date with the latest 
developments of the project. Information which is useful for all members of the 
project or not directed at a specific individual would be sent by e-mail. E-mail also 
has the advantage of communicating software directly between members and leaving
an audit trail to keep track of the project's progress.

\subsubsection{Telephone}

Each group member's contact phone numbers were shared at the beginning of the
project to complement e-mail communications. A contact by phone number would
be useful if very urgent information needs to be communicated immediately between
project members. Although e-mail communication should suffice, telephone 
communication would be used to instantly contact a group member who may not
be keeping up with e-mail exchanges.

\subsection{Source Control}
\label{source control}
We decided to use version control software throughout the project, to manage 
everything from minutes to source code and payload schematics. As well as 
being a very useful tool to facilitate group work, it also helps us to meet 
our customer's request to deliver this as an open source project - at the end 
of the project, a repository could easily be gardened and presented, with the 
addition of appropriate open-source licenses at the end of the project.

Initially, we used a central Subversion (SVN) repository hosted on ECS' 
UGForge service. It was decided to use this as most of the group had 
experience using SVN. This worked well for most of the project, but 
unfortunately, something was committed to this repository that could not be 
open sourced (the customer's Ground Control Station software). This presented 
us with a problem, as although it would be trivial to revert this commit with 
the "\$ svn merge" command, this creates a new commit, and the file in 
question would remain in the repository's history and could still be accessed.

In theory, it would be possible to remove this commit from SVN history by 
using the "\$ svnadmin dump" command, filtering the offending commit out of 
the dumpfile, and regenerate the repository with the "\$ svnadmin load" 
command. However, in practice, this was not possible as our repository 
contains binary information above 64kB, therefore the ASCII editor used to 
modify the dumpfile would cut off data in the binary file after the 64kB 
limit, rendering any following data useless.

It would be possible to start a new SVN repository and check in our 
repository up to but not including the offending commit, but we would lose 
all metadata (i.e. committer, commit time, etc.). Therefore, it was decided to 
switch to git, a distributed version control system (which would allow us to 
modify project history). Converting the repository using git-svn was a trivial 
process. Although not all of the group was confident using this tool, git 
lets a committer commit on behalf of another user. Moving to git also 
allowed us to use github, a hosting service, which is free to open-source 
projects (such as ours), which also provides us with some additional 
project statistics \cite{github}.
