\chapter{Testing}
%% ----------------------------------------------------------------
Any successful engineering project requires thorough testing. Testing throughout
the implementation of the system is essential, allowing the various stages of 
development to be verified before the next feature or stage is implemented.

Similarly testing is an important documentation tool, it allows us to determine the
exact specifications of the implemented system and helps us understand how it is 
expected to perform in real-life scenarios.

During the implementation of this system, thorough testing was an absolute
requirement. This chapter describes the various tests undertaken
throughout implementation in the terms of the milestones described in section
\ref{sec:amended_milestones}. 

Throughout this chapter, we will refer to milestones by their section numbers.
For example, the \emph{Basic Camera Connection} milestone will be referred
to as milestone \ref{sec:ms_basic_cam_comm}.
