\section{Risk Management (ms)}

A risk assessment was performed at the beginning of the project to make sure that the appropriate actions could be taken when confronted with a problem. 
The following table shows the risks the group has prepared for, the likelihood and 
impact of the risk which determines the priority of the risk, and the appropriate action in response to the risk.
