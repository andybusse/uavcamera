\section{Evaluation on Group Communication (ps)}
\label{evaluation on group communication}

The group has various way of communication and sending work around.
As describe in section\ref{source control}, there are problems about the subversion which some of the file that can not put in public accidentally put into the public folder.
This cause some of the group members tries to fixed this problem.
Although the subversion was effective, we have decided to change it to git.
Git is easy to use and all the members can learn it fast and there are no furthur problem.
This save time of combining report because git warn the user when they are submitting something that other member is working on it.
Therefore, all the work flow well and we have minimized the submission of work problems.

The way of communication by email was effective for our group.
Because all the members know how to use it, there is no time wasting on learning a new way of communication.
However, it is likely that some of the group members were misread some of the email.
To make this more powerful way of communication and to ensure that all the members have read the message, the group should have a rule that on every email, there must be a reply from all of the group member.

The formal meeting with supervisor that we have described in section\ref{group_comms} has been done successfully. 
Eventhough we have a weekly meeting with our supervisor, but we have been preparing the question well, therefore the group members are on track and clear about what their task is.
The customer also came to the meeting once in every two weeks and he satisfied with the project.
This make the project progress flows very smoothly because we were using UAV in the project and there are some problems on the connection between the payload and the UAV.
If we did not meet with our customer regularly and contact him by email, our work might not be able to finished.
However, we could make the use of the meeting more by showing some of the progess of our report on a way when we were implementing the project.
This could save our time during the report writing time.
