\section{Camera module}
\label{sec:John_chosen_options}

The camera type chosen was a serial camera as described in \ref{sec:Serial_option}. The particular model chosen was uCam (microCam) or the "Camera Module - Serial JPEG TTL" from the "coolcomponents" website.

The feature set of the uCam is as follows:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It can output images in both RAW and jpeg formats
		\item It can output RAW images at a range of resolutions:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 80 x 60
			\item 160 x 120
			\item 320 x 240
			\item 640 x 480
			\item 128 x 128
			\item 128 x 96
		\end{itemize}
		\item It can output jpeg images at a range of resolutions:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 80 x 64
			\item 160 x 128
			\item 320 x 240
			\item 640 x 480
		\end{itemize}
		\item it can output RAW images with a range of colour settings:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 2bit Gray Scale
			\item 4bit Gray Scale
			\item 8bit Gray Scale
			\item 8bit Colour
			\item 12bit Colour
			\item 16bit Colour
		\end{itemize}
		\item It will auto-detect baud rates from 14400 to 115200
		\item It has selectable baud rates up to 1228800
		\item Small physical size at 32mm x 32mm
		\item Well documented
	\end{itemize}

The camera was chosen because this feature set meets the specification and also allows for additional functionality, such as setting the resolution, if the full feature set is exploited.
