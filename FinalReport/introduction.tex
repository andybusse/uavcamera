The project aims in designing, implementing and testing a TCP/IP camera controller connect via UAV. The UAV ground receiver is a USB-compatible device. USB device driver has been developed by the customer’s in order to access hardware from a simple user application. The USB is active when the hose ask for a data. The data in its queue until the host ask for the data. The device has to listen to its address and request for its specific address. The TCP/IP connection between the port and the GUI must be implemented without any hesitation from the user. The data transmitted from the devices stream data to PC for further data processing (image processing).  The customer’s software is in user mode, where the programmer does not have the right to access directly to the hard ware in protected operating systems.
