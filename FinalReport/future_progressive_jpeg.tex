\subsection{Progressive Image Manipulation}
%% ----------------------------------------------------------------

The progressive image display was not fully implemented
by the end of the project. Below is a list of possible work
which can be undertaken to complete the progressive
image display system.

\subsubsection{JPEG Header Extractor}

The information obtained by the JPEG header extractor
has not been completely tested. The DQT information 
has yet to take into account multiple quantization tables
existing within a single DQT segment: only one 
quantization table is read. If a loop and struc similar to 
one implemented for the DHT is replicated for the DQT
segment, the extractor will be able to be tested and
implemented on the AVR.

The AVR implementation will require testing with
the ground station image displayer before it
can make it into a final product.

\subsubsection{Ground Station Software}

Little work was done for a ground station
progressive image displayer. An application would have
to be coded which will read in the information provided by
the extractor and display the image progressively.
This means that the application would need to reverse the
steps used to compress a raw image into JPEG given the 
coefficients of the Huffman tables and the quantization
tables. 

Attempting to reverse the custom compression of 
raw images MATLAB code using DCT can be a good 
starting point. If successful, reversing the quantization 
and Huffman encoding of the JPEG image would be 
required to obtain the information 
necessary to display the image.
