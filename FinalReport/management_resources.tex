\section{Team resources}
\label{team_resources}

This section of the management chapter covers how we controlled our use of physical resources rather than time or personnel resources. This consists of managing our budget and what we had to buy as well as what resources we had already or were provided with.

\subsection{Budget}

Our overall budget was Â£200

\subsection{Electronic Material}

Did we make use of anything electronic that we had before the project?
