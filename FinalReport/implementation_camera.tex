\subsection{Camera Module}
\label{sec:John_Implementation}

The first step in the implementation of the camera module was to verify the communication with the camera by talking to it via a pc. Once this step was complete the next step was to implement communications between the camera and a microprocessor, with the pc for debugging. With the microcontroller able to communicate with the camera this module was ready for integration with the payload.
