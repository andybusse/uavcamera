\section{Network and Port Connection(ps)}

TCP/IP is suitable for devices communication and it can be implemented in many software's languages.
The connection can refer a interconnect between host and router.
Host is a computer that run a program such as web browser, or any software on the computer\cite{davidB}.
Router is a device that can forward communication from one machine to the another.
There are many way to link intermachine using TCP.
Port connection is one way of connecting the TCP from the router to the host.
Port can refer to a hardware such as USB connection or it can refer to a processes on the machine \cite{normanM}.
Protocol is an agreement about the packet by communicating program and what they means.
Information that will send through the port will be a sequence of bytes data. 
These byte sequences generated are called packets\cite{davidB}.
It includes user data and control information.

TCP/IP is designed to detect and recover it losses, and other errors that might occur so the application does not have to deal with this \cite{davidB} i.e. the application data does not have to break the data on its own. It has function of connect to the computer, send and receive command, display flags, and set up the port values.
