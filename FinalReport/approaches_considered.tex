\chapter{Design Decisions}
%% ----------------------------------------------------------------
Throughout the design and implementation of the project there were many points
at which decisions were made about the design of the system. This chapter attempts
to give an insight into some of the design decisions taken throughout the project with
a discussion of the alternative choices that were open to us at the time and the reasons
why a particular choice was made.

This chapter also details some of the ways in which the initial milestones mentioned in section
\ref{sec:initial_milestones} have been amended and changed by design decisions throughout
the course of the project. These amended milestones can be seen in section \ref{sec:amended_milestones}.

\section{Physical Implementation}

Our specification states that the final module delivered to the customer 
should be on PCB, if time permits.
