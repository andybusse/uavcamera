\section{Flight Testing (ab)}

In theory, not much should change between our laboratory tests and a flight 
test: the only difference is that the payload is operated in a 
harsher environment, and the Autopilot to Ground Station is via a XBee wireless 
link, not a USB Serial cable. The robustness of the wireless link is 
not as good as the serial link, and we expect packets to either be corrupted 
or dropped entirely.

It was initially planned to perform a flight test with our customer and his 
supporting team, our supervisor, and our entire group at Cheesefoot Head in 
Winchester on the 9th December 2011.

Unfortunately, on the 7th December, our board camera stopped functioning. 
This meant the planned flight test has to be cancelled.

Another flight test is set to be scheduled in early January, weather-permitting. 
A third board camera has been ordered, and our payload module appears to be 
functioning correctly, this bodes well for our upcoming flight test. We plan to develop the packet verification and 
automatic repeat request parts of our software in the intervening time.
