This section of the evaluation looks at potential additions to this project, 
which we would have done if time permitted. This starts with parts of the 
specification that we were not able to implement, and continues with some 
more advanced additions that we have considered.

\subsection{Ground Station Software}

The Ground Station Software which we have submitted remains rather buggy. 
There is a memory leakage issue which causes both our and SkyCircuits' 
software to crash after viewing a certain number of images, we have not had the time to resolve. This is not altogether critical, as the software 
is functional, and once re-started will re-connect to the autopilot. 
As the autopilot is autonomous, can take control of an aircraft from takeoff 
to landing, and is subservient to a manual controller, this is not a critical 
issue, but one that 

It is also not feature-complete (see \ref{sec:incomplete}), something which 
could be resolved with some fairly trivial modifications to our code.

\subsection{Video Streaming}

A rather interesting advancement of this project would be to try and implement 
real-time video streaming from the UAV. This would almost certainly have to use 
a dedicated wireless link. The 38.4 kBaud available in the autopilot modules 
is too restrictive for this sort of application, but the autopilot would still 
be able to control such an application (i.e. able to start/stop transmission, 
toggle power to the module, minimising delay between video capture and video 
display, 

\subsection{Using Multiple Cameras}

Another interesting application would be to mount multiple cameras (of the same 
model purchased for this project) on the UAV, and either take pictures from all 
the cameras at the same time, from some of the cameras at the same time, etc. 
The main issue here will be multiplexing the serial connection to all of the 
cameras, something considered for this project but ultimately not chosen.

\subsection{Using Multiple Types of Camera}

It would be useful to provide a range of camera modules to the customer, and 
an electronic module that would be able to communicate with all of them. This 
would include all the types of camera we considered (USB, serial and analogue), 
with varying resolutions. This would be rather difficult to implement, as the 
standards used across two types of the same camera interface can be rather 
different, so a driver would need to be written for each type of camera used. 
Also, the budget for such a project would be quite high.
