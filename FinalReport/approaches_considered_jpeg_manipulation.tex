\section{Image Manipulation (ms)}
\label{sec:progressiveimagedisplay}

The design of the progressive image
display system to be implemented on the
payload and the ground station required some
important decisions to be made before 
development could begin. This included
the type of image file which would be
manipulated, how the image sent from the camera on 
the UAV would be accessed,
and the method of storing the data
and sending it to the ground station.

\subsection{Image File to Manipulate}

The first design decision was to choose the type of image 
file which would be the most practical to work with given
the properties of the camera and the
capabilities of the payload software.

\subsubsection{Approach: Custom Raw Image Manipulation}

This approach involves using the custom image 
manipulation algorithm as specified 
in section \ref{Custom_comp_research} on bitmap-type RGB images.

Advantages:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Would be able to handle the images
		given by the camera regardless of the format
		the camera saves the image.
	\item Avoids quantization to allow 
		for lossless compression: No information is
		lost when the image is 
		compressed and decompressed.
	\item Uses a simple, reliable, and easy to 
		understand image compression technique
		(Discrete Cosine Transform)
	\item Can more easily create a progressive
		display of the image due to having less
		information to decode.
\end{itemize}

Disadvantages:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Restricted to decoding raw images; 
		cannot deal with JPEG images.
	\item Does not compress the image as 
		efficiently as more advanced 
		image compression techniques.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Approach: JPEG File Manipulation}

This approach involves manipulating JPEG standard image 
files instead of raw image files. This requires the
microcontroller to work around the compression offered
by the JPEG file standard (see section \ref{jpeg_image_compression}).

Advantages:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Compatible with most standard
		camera outputs.
	\item Takes advantage of the reliable and
		efficient JPEG compression algorithm.
	\item Uses quantization to allow for a greater
		degree of image compression.
\end{itemize}

Disadvantages:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Compression is lossy: image loses 
		more and more information 
		each time it is compressed 
		(saved and opened).
	\item Requires more sophisticated and complex
		decompression algorithms.
	\item Requires more background research to
		understand and manipulate.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Chosen Approach: JPEG Manipulation}

Before the camera was agreed upon, work began on the
custom raw image compression algorithm. This
allowed us to get a good idea of how the progressive
display of the image would work in the final product.
When the camera was chosen, it's output
included JPEG image files. Since JPEG provides
superior compression to simple custom methods 
this approach was chosen to help produce a fast initial system.

\subsection{JPEG File Manipulation}
\label{sec:jpegmanipulation}

This section weighs the decision of implementing a 
form of custom JPEG image manipulation to allow the 
image to be displayed progressively, as requested by the customer.

\subsubsection{Approach: Custom JPEG Manipulation}

This design approach details the choice to code an algorithm which 
would modify the image received from the camera in order to 
display it progressively. Ideally, this would send an extremely low 
detail image to the ground station which would progressively improve 
while more information is sent from the camera by implementing 
the higher frequency components of the image.

Advantages:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Allows an image to be sent and 
                     be manually evaluated sooner.
	\item Allows the user to cancel images which begin to show 
		unwanted information, saving processing time.
	\item Can possibly allow the image information to be 
		optimized, sending only the 
		information necessary for display.
\end{itemize}

Disadvantages:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Requires effort and time, including research into 
		the manipulation of the JPEG format.
	\item Benefit is minimal if the sending a simple image 
		is already very quick.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Approach: Standard JPEG Transfer}

This design approach simply displays the JPEG image from 
the camera as it is received. 

Advantages:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Requires little to no effort 
		(already done by default).
	\item All the metadata of the image is kept unchanged.
\end{itemize}

Disadvantages:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Takes time to send all the image data to the ground station.
	\item During the transfer period, state of image is unknown and 
		can be wasted if image is undesirable.
	\item Image sends all the metadata, including 
		metadata which can be ignored.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Chosen Approach: Custom JPEG Manipulation}

Prior to knowing the exact speed it would take to send 
an image from the camera to the ground station, 
it was decided that custom JPEG manipulation would optimize 
the image further and help reach the target time specified (3 minutes, see \ref{sec:spec_b}). 
Therefore, tasks concerning the custom manipulation of 
the JPEG image were planned and worked on 
at the beginning of the project. 
However, when a working module was constructed, the time needed to 
send the image was already well within the time specified. 
Because this was the primary advantage of the 
custom JPEG manipulation process, 
the task's priority was dropped accordingly.

\subsection{Entropy-Encoded Data Storage}

Another major decision to make was the method of 
storing the entropy-encoded image data of the JPEG file, 
which is divided into chrominance pixels made up of 
3 different components.(See section 
\ref{sec:colour_space_conversion} for
more information on chrominance pixels.)

\subsubsection{Approach: Store As Chrominance Pixels}

This method stores the chrominance pixels in 
the image one by one. 
The data is stored in a linked list of chrominance pixels, 
containing a certain number of Y values and 
one pair of Cb and Cr values.

Advantages:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Makes the YCbCr colour modelling method 
		more obvious. 
		This method intuitively partitions the 
		encoded image data using the YCbCr convention.
	\item Requires little data manipulation. 
		Structures are made as input stream is read in, 
		one at a time.
	\item Comprehensive memory allocation. 
		Allocates the appropriate memory for 
		one chrominance pixel as needed.
\end{itemize}

Disadvantages:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Encoded image data becomes more 
		difficult to apply progressive scans to.
	\item No spatial information is stored. 
		Data is stored as a linear list of chrominance 
		pixels instead of a table representing the image.
	\item Memory must be allocated dynamically. 
		More vulnerable to insufficient memory 
		crashes during the extraction process.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Approach: Store Components Seperately}

This method of accessing the image data involves 
storing the three components Y, Cb, and Cr into tables.

Advantages:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Makes progressive scanning easier. 
		The three components can be selected individually.
	\item Information can be stored in a table to 
		represent the image spatially.
	\item Memory can be allocated either 
		dynamically or prior to the read process.
\end{itemize}

Disadvantages:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Requires more manipulation of the 
		entropy-encoded image data as it is read in. 
		Components must be monitored to not 
		lose chrominance pixel grouping.
	\item Chrominance information must be stored either 
		unintuitive (a smaller table than the image) or 
		inefficiently (an image sized table with empty values).
	\item Generally more difficult to monitor the information stored.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Chosen Approach: Store As Chrominance Pixels}

The entropy-encoded data will be stored as chrominance 
pixels for the sake of clarity. 
It is also a method which could be coded more easily 
than separate component storage. 
This allowed the AVR to work with the progressive 
JPEG encoder sooner to avoid the task from overrunning.
