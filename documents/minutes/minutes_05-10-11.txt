Spec of the GDP

	-Power- 5V & 3.3V ~100mA
	-Weight ~100g
	-design, test, capture and transmit an image from UAV to base station
	-camera module
	-transmit with low bandwidth
	-use autopilot datalink
	-camera<--> microcontroller<-->auto pilot <--> base station <--> software
	-(<-->=communicate 2 direction)
	-design a camera module to obtain image
	-construct final module on PCB
	-write a software to interface with the ground station over TCP/IP link
	-allow the software to receive and display image
	-camera module on PCB
	-make all schemetic and code accessible by the customers
	-test hardware on UAV
	-Readme file for the software

Task to do 
	-acquire equipment
		-order (camera, parts)
		-wait
	-get picture from camera
	-encode(compression of image)/decode (decompression of image)
	-transmit image
	-get picture to the software
	-UI
	-background reading
	-testing
	-component selection
	-camera command (triggering, etc.)
	-TCP/IP
	-build & test (Bread board and PCB)
	-Integration
	-prepare presentation
	-make these communications work:camera<--> microcontroller<-->auto pilot <--> base station <--> software
	-report writing
