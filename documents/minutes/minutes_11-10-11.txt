Location: Library, Study Room 1A
Date/Time: 11/10/2011, 1600-1730
Agenda: * Review progress made, and assign tasks for the week ahead
In Attendance: Mitch, Andy, Peak, John, Michael

-----
Work Done:
* Obtained a Camera
* Basic MATLAB compression code has been achieved
* Work on getting some useful data out of the camera has started (using Arduino, in progress)

-----
Work for the coming week (12/10 - 19/10)
* Get image off the camera (need a memory buffer, multiple resolutions) [John, Michael]
* Parse image data from the camera [John, Michael]
* Order remaining parts for prototyping autopilot peripheral from Farnell on 12/10 am [John, Michael]
* Construct a prototype autopilot peripheral, based on client's schematics [Andy, Peak]
* Play around with DSPs given to us by stores/supervisor, run an FFT on them (- Progressive JPEG?) [Andy, Peak]
* MATLAB Compression - Image Specific, and general [Mitch, Michael, John]
* Payload Controller - Ground Station Protocol (i.e. sending commands to a payload, receiving data back from it) (SCPI?) [Andy, Peak]

-----
Targets for 19/10
* AVR (or any other uProcessor) code to get an image from the webcam onto a computer
* Code to display image from the webcam (raw data, and jpeg_.
* Obtain all parts for prototyping
* Prototype for the payload on breadboard, with schematic
* DSP selected > FFT function achieved on DSP
* 50% image specific compressing MATLAB code
* 50% lossless compression MATLAB code
